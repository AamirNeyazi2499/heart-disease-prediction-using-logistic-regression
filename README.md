# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on medical attributes using **Logistic Regression**. It demonstrates how classification models can assist in healthcare prediction and decision-making.

---

## 📘 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on factors like:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting Electrocardiographic(ecg) Results
- Exchange Transfusion
- Heart Rate Slope
- Thalassemia
- Cardiac Arrest 

The model uses **Logistic Regression**, a supervised machine learning algorithm for binary classification.
